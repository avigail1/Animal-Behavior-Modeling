# Animal Behavior Modeling

This repository contains a simple implementation of animal behavior modeling in C#.

## Overview

The project consists of the following classes:
- `Animal`: An abstract class representing basic animal properties and behaviors.
- `Cat`: A class representing a cat, inheriting from `Animal` and implementing the `Land` interface.
- `Dog`: A class representing a dog, inheriting from `Animal` and implementing the `Land` interface.
- `Frog`: A class representing a frog, inheriting from `Animal` and implementing the `Land` and `Water` interfaces.
- `Land`: An interface defining the method to get the number of legs for land animals.
- `Water`: An interface defining methods to check if an animal has gills and lays eggs.

## Usage

The project creates an array of animals, including cats, dogs, and frogs, initializes them with different moods, and then displays their information and greets them based on their mood.

## How to Run

To run the project, simply clone the repository, open it in your preferred C# IDE, and run the program. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
